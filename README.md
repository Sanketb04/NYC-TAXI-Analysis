# ðŸš– NYC Taxi Data Engineering Project  

An end-to-end Data Engineering project focused on processing and analyzing NYC Taxi data using modern cloud technologies.  

---

## ðŸ“‹ **Project Overview**  
This project demonstrates a complete data engineering pipeline using **Azure Data Factory**, **Databricks**, and **Delta Lake**. The pipeline handles data ingestion, transformation, storage, and analytics for NYC Taxi datasets.  

---

## ðŸ’» **Technologies Used**  
- **Azure Data Factory**: Orchestration and ETL pipeline development.  
- **Databricks**: Scalable data processing and analytics using Apache Spark.  
- **Delta Lake**: Reliable, ACID-compliant data storage solution.  
- **Azure Blob Storage**: Storing raw and processed data.  
- **Azure Synapse Analytics**: Query and visualization.  

---

ðŸ”‘ Key Features
-Data Ingestion: Automating the ingestion of NYC Taxi data into Azure Blob Storage.
-Data Transformation: Using Databricks notebooks for ETL tasks, including filtering, aggregations, and enrichment.
-Delta Lake Integration: Ensuring data reliability with versioned tables and ACID compliance.
-Orchestration: Seamlessly integrating processes using Azure Data Factory.
-Data Analytics: Querying data in Azure Synapse Analytics for business insights.

ðŸš€ How to Run the Project
